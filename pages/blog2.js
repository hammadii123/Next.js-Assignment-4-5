      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing software development
        processes. From automating mundane coding tasks to enhancing security
        and optimizing code, AI tools are reshaping how developers build
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI-driven code assistants like GitHub Copilot and TabNine are helping
        developers write code faster and more efficiently. Machine learning
        algorithms are being integrated into development environments to detect
        bugs and optimize performance in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of software development is set to become more AI-driven, with
        faster release cycles, improved code quality, and fewer human errors.
